anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies with voluntary institutions . these are often described as stateless societies , but several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations . anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , or harmful . while anti-statism is central , anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations , including , but not limited to , the state system .
as an anti-dogmatic philosophy , anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy . anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy . there are many types and traditions of anarchism , not all of which are mutually exclusive . anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism . strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications . anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology , and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism , or participatory economics .
etymology and terminology .
the term `` anarchism '' is a compound word composed from the word `` anarchy '' and the suffix '' - ism '' , themselves derived respectively from the greek , i.e. `` anarchy '' -lrb- from , `` anarchos '' , meaning `` one without rulers '' ; from the privative prefix ἀν - -lrb- `` an - '' , i.e. `` without '' -rrb- and , `` archos '' , i.e. `` leader '' , `` ruler '' ; -lrb- cf. `` archon '' or , `` arkhē '' , i.e. `` authority '' , `` sovereignty '' , `` realm '' , `` magistracy '' -rrb- -rrb- and the suffix or -lrb- '' - ismos '' , '' - isma '' , from the verbal infinitive suffix - ίζειν , '' - izein '' -rrb- . the first known use of this word was in 1539 . various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists -lrb- as robespierre did the hébertists -rrb- although few shared many views of later anarchists . there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation , such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling , but they did not use the word `` anarchist '' or `` anarchism '' in describing themselves or their beliefs .
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre-joseph proudhon , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century . since the 1890s , and beginning in france , the term `` libertarianism '' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the united states ; its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states . on the other hand , some use `` libertarianism '' to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only , referring to free-market anarchism as `` libertarian anarchism '' .
the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century bc , among the works of taoist philosopher laozi , and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan . zhuangzi 's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist . zhuangzi wrote , `` a petty thief is put in jail . a great brigand becomes a ruler of a nation . '' diogenes of sinope and the cynics , their contemporary zeno of citium , the founder of stoicism , also introduced similar topics . jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition . georges lechartier wrote that `` the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles . '' in early islamic history , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate , where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society . later , some muslim scholars , such as amer al-basri and abu hanifa , led movements of boycotting the rulers , paving the way to the waqf -lrb- endowments -rrb- tradition , which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs . but such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible . this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry .
the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the `` discourse on voluntary servitude '' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent .
the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england . the term `` anarchist '' first entered the english language in 1642 , during the english civil war , as a term of abuse , used by royalists against their roundhead opponents . by the time of the french revolution some , such as the `` enragés '' , began to use the term positively , in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power , seeing `` revolutionary government '' as oxymoronic . by the turn of the 19th century , the english word `` anarchism '' had lost its initial negative connotation .
modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment , particularly jean-jacques rousseau 's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
as part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the french revolution , william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought . godwin was , according to peter kropotkin , `` the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism , even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work '' , while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke .
godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as ` philosophical anarchism ' . he argued in `` political justice '' -lrb- 1793 -rrb- that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society , and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance . he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force . although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy , he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power . rather , he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution .
his aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce , as a manifestation of the people 's ` mental enslavement ' , the foundations of law , property rights and even the institution of marriage . he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation . in each case , government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment .
the french pierre-joseph proudhon is regarded as the first `` self-proclaimed '' anarchist , a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work , `` what is property ? , '' published in 1840 . it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory . he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society , where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests ; his famous quote on the matter is , `` liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order . '' in `` what is property ? '' proudhon answers with the famous accusation `` property is theft . '' in this work , he opposed the institution of decreed `` property '' -lrb- `` propriété '' -rrb- , where owners have complete rights to `` use and abuse '' their property as they wish . he contrasted this with what he called `` possession , '' or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use . later , however , proudhon added that `` property is liberty , '' and argued that it was a bulwark against state power . his opposition to the state , organised religion , and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists , and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time .
the anarcho-communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as `` libertarian '' . unlike pierre-joseph proudhon , he argued that , `` it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature . '' in 1844 in germany the post-hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book , `` the ego and its own , '' which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism . french anarchists active in the 1848 revolution included anselme bellegarrigue , ernest coeurderoy , joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon .
first international and the paris commune .
in europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings . after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists , anarchists , liberals , and nationalists , to prevent further revolt . in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal `` el porvenir '' in la coruña in 1845 which was inspired by proudhon ´ s ideas . the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon 's works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in 1873 while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party . according to george woodcock `` these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after 1870 , but before that time proudhonian ideas , as interpreted by pi , already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860 's . '' according to the `` encyclopedia britannica '' `` during the spanish revolution of 1873 , pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralized , or `` cantonalist , '' political system on proudhonian lines . ''
in 1864 the international workingmen 's association -lrb- sometimes called the `` first international '' -rrb- united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon , blanquists , philadelphes , english trade unionists , socialists and social democrats . due to its links to active workers ' movements , the international became a significant organisation . karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council . proudhon 's followers , the mutualists , opposed marx 's state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b. greene had been members of the first international . in 1868 , following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom -lrb- lpf -rrb- , russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international -lrb- which had decided not to get involved with the lpf -rrb- . they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property .
at first , the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction . subsequently , the international became polarised into two camps , with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads . bakunin characterised marx 's ideas as centralist and predicted that , if a marxist party came to power , its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against . anarchist historian george woodcock reports that `` the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune , and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london . one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy , while a technical excuse -- that they had split away from the fédération romande -- was used to avoid inviting bakunin 's swiss supporters . thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present , and the general council 's resolutions passed almost unanimously . most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers . '' in 1872 , the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress , where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york . in response , the federalist sections formed their own international at the st. imier congress , adopting a revolutionary anarchist program .
the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 18 march -lrb- more formally , from 28 march -rrb- to 28 may 1871 . the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco-prussian war . anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune . they included george woodcock states :
organised labour .
the anti-authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists , seeking to `` replace the privilege and authority of the state '' with the `` free and spontaneous organisation of labour . '' in 1886 , the federation of organized trades and labor unions -lrb- fotlu -rrb- of the united states and canada unanimously set 1 may 1886 , as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard .
in response , unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event . on 3 may , in chicago , a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line , and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd . the next day , 4 may , anarchists staged a rally at chicago 's haymarket square . a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally , killing an officer . in the ensuing panic , police opened fire on the crowd and each other . seven police officers and at least four workers were killed . eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer . the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement . four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution . the incident became known as the haymarket affair , and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day . in 1890 a second attempt , this time international in scope , to organise for the eight-hour day was made . the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair . although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event , by the following year the celebration of international workers ' day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker 's holiday .
in 1907 , the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries , among which important figures of the anarchist movement , including errico malatesta , pierre monatte , luigi fabbri , benoît broutchoux , emma goldman , rudolf rocker , and christiaan cornelissen . various themes were treated during the congress , in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement , popular education issues , the general strike or antimilitarism . a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism -lrb- or trade unionism -rrb- . malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue , as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution , while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient . he thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials . malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
the spanish workers federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement ; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain . the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo -lrb- national confederation of labour : cnt -rrb- , founded in 1910 . before the 1940s , the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics , attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war . the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association , a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 , with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america . in latin america in particular `` the anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america , and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in mexico , brazil , peru , chile , and argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook ; the prestige of the spanish c.n.t. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation . the largest and most militant of these organizations was the federación obrera regional argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million , which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions . ''
propaganda of the deed and illegalism .
some anarchists , such as johann most , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because `` we preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda . '' by the 1880s , people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan , `` propaganda of the deed '' to refer to individual bombings , regicides , and tyrannicides . from 1905 onwards , the russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ` expropriations ' . '' illegalism as a practice emerged and within it `` the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins -lrb- `` propaganda by the deed '' -rrb- and the anarchist burglars -lrb- `` individual reappropriation '' -rrb- expressed their desperation and their personal , violent rejection of an intolerable society . moreover , they were clearly meant to be `` exemplary '' invitations to revolt . '' . france 's bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism .
however , as soon as 1887 , important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts . peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in `` le révolté '' that `` a structure based on centuries of history can not be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite '' . a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action , for example through the trade union movement . the anarcho-syndicalist , fernand pelloutier , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without `` the individual dynamiter . ''
state repression -lrb- including the infamous 1894 french `` lois scélérates '' -rrb- of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics , although reciprocally state repression , in the first place , may have played a role in these isolated acts . the dismemberment of the french socialist movement , into many groups and , following the suppression of the 1871 paris commune , the execution and exile of many `` communards '' to penal colonies , favoured individualist political expression and acts .
numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement , including tsar alexander ii of russia , president sadi carnot of france , empress elisabeth of austria , king umberto i of italy , president william mckinley of the united states , king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece . mckinley 's assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman .
propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after world war i -lrb- 1914 -- 1918 -rrb- and the 1917 october revolution .
russian revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s .
anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions , and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution . however , following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition , the conflict culminated in the 1921 kronstadt rebellion , which the new government repressed . anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned , driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks ; the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine . there , in the free territory , they fought in the civil war against the whites -lrb- a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution -rrb- and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months .
expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising , before they left russia . both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia , criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised . for them , bakunin 's predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new `` socialist '' marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true .
the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally . many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example ; communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements . in france and the united states , for example , members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international .
the revolutionary wave of 1917 -- 23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism . in the german uprising known as the german revolution of 1918 -- 1919 which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer , silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures . in the italian events known as the `` biennio rosso '' the anarcho-syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana `` grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the italian anarchist union -lrb- 20,000 members plus `` umanita nova '' , its daily paper -rrb- grew accordingly ... anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces . in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho-communist ricardo flores magón .
in paris , the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles , which included nestor makhno , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism . their 1926 manifesto , called the `` organisational platform of the general union of anarchists -lrb- draft -rrb- '' , was supported . platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america . synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives . in the 1920s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure . it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .
conflicts with european fascist regimes .
in the 1920s and 1930s , the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism 's conflict with the state . italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists . italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation `` arditi del popolo '' , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions , and achieved some success in their activism , such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august 1922 . the veteran italian anarchist , luigi fabbri , was one of the first critical theorists of fascism , describing it as `` the preventive counter-revolution . '' in france , where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february 1934 riots , anarchists divided over a united front policy .
anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii . in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 february 1933 , within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin . joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister , labelled him as one of `` those jewish subversives . '' over the next seventeen months , he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg , brandenburg and finally , oranienburg . on 2 february 1934 , mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 july 1934 , mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards , his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning .
spanish revolution .
in spain , the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance , and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory . but in 1936 , the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power . months later , the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war -lrb- 1936 -- 1939 -rrb- . in response to the army rebellion , an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias , took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land . but even before the fascist victory in 1939 , the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists , who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union . the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers ' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years , primarily catalonia , aragon , andalusia , and parts of the levante . much of spain 's economy was put under worker control ; in anarchist strongholds like catalonia , the figure was as high as 75 % , but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence , as the soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment . factories were run through worker committees , agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes . anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution , which he claimed `` came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history . ''
stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists . the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri , who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party .
post-war years .
anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france . the mexican anarchist federation was established in 1945 after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district . in the early 1940s , the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba -lrb- cuban libertarian association -rrb- . from 1944 to 1947 , the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement , but was repressed by the new communist regime . in 1945 in france the fédération anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy . korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september 1945 and in 1946 the japanese anarchist federation was founded . an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may 1948 . after world war ii , an appeal in the `` fraye arbeter shtime '' detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them . by february 1946 , the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a large-scale operation . the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in 1947 and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ , `` die freie gesellschaft '' , which survived until 1953 . in 1956 the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded . in 1955 the anarcho-communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation . the syndicalist workers ' federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war britain , and one of solidarity federation 's earliest predecessors . it was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain . unlike the afb , which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself , the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist , worker-centred strategy from the outset .
anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time , such as albert camus , herbert read , paul goodman , dwight macdonald , allen ginsberg , george woodcock , leopold kohr , julian beck , john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste .
anarcho-pacifism became influential in the anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho-pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day . anarcho-pacifism became a `` basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war . '' the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham 's , `` volume two : the emergence of the new anarchism -lrb- 1939 -- 1977 -rrb- '' .
contemporary anarchism .
a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s . anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts . in 1968 in carrara , italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing european federations of france -lrb- the fédération anarchiste -rrb- , the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile .
in the united kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement , as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols . the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona , spain . in denmark , squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania , an autonomous haven in central copenhagen . since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century , a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged . although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism , they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s . anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism , with those `` who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits '' of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are `` much more informed , among other elements , by indigenous , feminist , ecological and cultural-critical ideas '' , and who by the turn of the 21st century formed `` by far the majority '' of anarchists .
around the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war , anti-capitalist , and anti-globalisation movements . anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , group of eight , and the world economic forum . some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting , property destruction , and violent confrontations with police . these actions were precipitated by ad hoc , leaderless , anonymous cadres known as `` black blocs '' ; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture , affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet . a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 1999 . according to anarchist scholar simon critchley , `` contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ... one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility , whether sexual , ecological or socio-economic ; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest ; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality , impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally . ''
international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations , the international workers ' association , and international libertarian solidarity .
the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain , in the form of the confederación general del trabajo -lrb- cgt -rrb- and the cnt . cgt membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003 . other active syndicalist movements include in sweden the central organisation of the workers of sweden and the swedish anarcho-syndicalist youth federation ; the cnt-ait in france ; the union sindicale italiana in italy ; in the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation and anarchist federation . the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world , claiming 3,000 paying members , and the international workers association , an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the first international , also remain active .
anarchist schools of thought .
anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions , individualist anarchism and social anarchism , which have some different origins , values and evolution . the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty , i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual , while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one 's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill , `` recognizing equality of entitlement '' . in a chronological and theoretical sense , there are classical -- those created throughout the 19th century -- and post-classical anarchist schools -- those created since the mid-20th century and after .
beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism , which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it . a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate , and usually temporary , `` necessary evil '' but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy . one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was `` anarchism without adjectives '' , a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the `` bitter debates '' of anarchist theory at the time . in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms -lrb- i.e. collectivist - , communist - , mutualist -- and individualist-anarchism -rrb- , it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought .
classical anarchist schools of thought .
mutualism began in 18th-century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre-joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states . proudhon proposed spontaneous order , whereby organisation emerges without central authority , a `` positive anarchy '' where order arises when everybody does `` what he wishes and only what he wishes '' and where `` business transactions alone produce the social order . '' it is important to recognize that proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance . for this reason , much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance , proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and , in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives , promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service .
mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation , and credit and currency reform . according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene , each worker in the mutualist system would receive `` just and exact pay for his work ; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost , without profit or discount . '' mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism . proudhon first characterised his goal as a `` third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . ''
individualist anarchism .
individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups , society , traditions , and ideological systems . individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict .
in 1793 , william godwin , who has often been cited as the first anarchist , wrote `` political justice '' , which some consider the first expression of anarchism . godwin , a philosophical anarchist , from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present `` necessary evil '' that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge . godwin advocated individualism , proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good .
an influential form of individualist anarchism , called `` egoism , '' or egoist anarchism , was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism , the german max stirner . stirner 's `` the ego and its own '' , published in 1844 , is a founding text of the philosophy . according to stirner , the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire , without regard for god , state , or morality . to stirner , rights were `` spooks '' in the mind , and he held that society does not exist but `` the individuals are its reality '' . stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists , non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties ' support through an act of will , which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state . egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals . `` egoism '' has inspired many interpretations of stirner 's philosophy . it was re-discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and lgbt activist john henry mackay .
josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist , and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833 , `` the peaceful revolutionist '' , was the first anarchist periodical published . for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster `` it is apparent ... that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews ... william b. greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form . '' . henry david thoreau -lrb- 1817 -- 1862 -rrb- was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe . thoreau was an american author , poet , naturalist , tax resister , development critic , surveyor , historian , philosopher , and leading transcendentalist . he is best known for his books `` walden '' , a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings , and his essay , `` civil disobedience '' , an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state . later benjamin tucker fused stirner 's egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication `` liberty '' .
from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals , free love and birth control advocates -lrb- see anarchism and issues related to love and sex -rrb- , individualist naturists nudists -lrb- see anarcho-naturism -rrb- , freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation -lrb- see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france -rrb- . these authors and activists included oscar wilde , emile armand , han ryner , henri zisly , renzo novatore , miguel gimenez igualada , adolf brand and lev chernyi among others .

autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction , verbal and non-verbal communication , and restricted and repetitive behavior . parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child 's life . these signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress . the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood , typically before age three .
while autism is highly heritable , researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes . in rare cases , autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects . controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example , the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven . autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ; how this occurs is not well understood . it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum -lrb- asds -rrb- , the other two being asperger syndrome , which lacks delays in cognitive development and language , and pervasive developmental disorder , not otherwise specified -lrb- commonly abbreviated as pdd-nos -rrb- , which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome are not met .
early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care , social , and communication skills . although there is no known cure , there have been reported cases of children who recovered . not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some become successful . an autistic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder .
globally , autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013 . as of 2010 , the number of people affected is estimated at about 1 -- 2 per 1,000 worldwide . it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls . about 1.5 % of children in the united states -lrb- one in 68 -rrb- are diagnosed with asd , a 30 % increase from one in 88 in 2012 . the rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the united kingdom is 1.1 % . the number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s , partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses ; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved .
autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without remission . people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others . overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years , and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . it is distinguished not by a single symptom , but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction ; impairments in communication ; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior . other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . autism 's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits .
social development .
social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders -lrb- asd ; see classification -rrb- from other developmental disorders . people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted . noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling `` like an anthropologist on mars '' .
unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood . autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name . autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn-taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things . three - to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , imitate and respond to emotions , communicate nonverbally , and take turns with others . however , they do form attachments to their primary caregivers . most childen with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd . older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to defines a person 's own emotions .
children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone . making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism . for them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel . functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply .
there are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with asd . the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and tantrums .
about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs . differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of babbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsiveness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver . in the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words . children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words -lrb- echolalia -rrb- or reverse pronouns . joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech , and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd : for example , they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience . children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language .
in a pair of studies , high-functioning children with autism aged 8 -- 15 performed equally well as , and adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling . both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference . as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends .
repetitive behavior .
autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the repetitive behavior scale-revised -lrb- rbs-r -rrb- categorizes as follows .
no single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors .
other symptoms .
autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family .
an estimated 0.5 % to 10 % of individuals with asd show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants . many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population . sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders . differences are greater for under-responsivity -lrb- for example , walking into things -rrb- than for over-responsivity -lrb- for example , distress from loud noises -rrb- or for sensation seeking -lrb- for example , rhythmic movements -rrb- . an estimated 60 % -- 80 % of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper .
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with asd , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator . selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur ; this does not appear to result in malnutrition . although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms , there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual ; studies report conflicting results , and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear .
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress . siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship . however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults .
it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism 's characteristic triad of symptoms . however , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur .
autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants . complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression . studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for asd , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population . however , most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified . typically , autism can not be traced to a mendelian -lrb- single-gene -rrb- mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd . numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects attributable to any particular gene . the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations -- spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis . hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome .
several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism . some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways , such as those involved with cell adhesion . gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes . all known teratogens -lrb- agents that cause birth defects -rrb- related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development .
exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the risk of autism . environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism , or may be important in future research , include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , diesel exhaust , pcbs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and prenatal stress , although no links have been found , and some have been completely disproven .
parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination . this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine `` overload '' , a vaccine preservative , or the mmr vaccine for causing autism . the latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been `` an elaborate fraud '' . although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children .
autism 's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain . how autism occurs is not well understood . its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors . the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies .
