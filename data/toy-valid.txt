federally , williamsburg is part of virginia 's 1st congressional district , represented by republican rob wittman , elected in 2007 .
the `` city '' which williamsburg became in 1722 had portions located in both james city and york county . in 1870 , the virginia general assembly changed the boundaries so that it was entirely within james city county . the new state constitution which took effect that year also created the political entity known as an independent city , which is not located in any county . williamsburg subsequently met the requirements and changed to that status , continuing to share a joint court system . the city also operates a joint school division with james city county , under voluntary agreement which leaders revisit at planned intervals .
